# DoaRacket



## My thoughts

A small game written in Racket to explore some of the fundamentals exposed by a language such as Racket. Concepts particularly of interest were functional programming and recursion. Other minor ideas that were interesting to explore were lists and the practicality of prefix notations.

Exploring a programming language that were wildly different from JS and C# really challenged my ideas of how languages should be constructed and really made an impression on me.
